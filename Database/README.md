## Karve Ski Demos

Karve is an online ski demo subscription for enthusiasts who always want the ideal gear for current snow conditions. Members have access to hundreds of skis at the touch of a button, delivered to their doorstep, with the freedom to swap products at any time with no additional cost.

To see how I populated this database with thousands of rows of highly realistic data, simulating normal and skewed distributions for customer measures based on gender, adding seasonality for consumer behavior, simulating ski damage patterns, and much more, see [Python Projects](../PythonProjects/README.md/#top).

Here is the diagram for Karve's OLTP database.
