# Fall 2018 Infographic Contest - Daniels College of Business
### 2nd Place Winner
<hr>

I created this infographic with the goal of grabbing attention, since the contest was based on student votes.

In the real world, this is not a great infographic. It's too detailed and colorful.

If its purpose were to communicate information effectively (as an infographic should) I would simplify it and make ample use of white space, as seen in my other work.
